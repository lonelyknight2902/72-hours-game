hour_value: 8
scene_description: |
  The land here smells of broken earth and splintered wood.
  The old barns and family homes now lie collapsed in tangled heaps of timber and stone.
  As reported by the locals, two survivors were last seen — one near the main barn, another inside the old farmhouse — but no one has heard from them since the shaking stopped.
  You and your team stand at the edge of the wreckage, boots sinking into the muddy soil.

        The earthquake has left the small farm village in chaos. Debris is scattered across the fields, and the air is thick with dust. Your rescue team arrives to discover that two victims are missing.
        However, the locals have reported last seeing a little girl playing in the old farmhouse and a middle-age farmer in the main barn.

        Your team breaches the main barn, or what it used to be. A part of the silo next to it has collapsed, and the barn is filled with debris. 
        The wooden beams groan under their own weight, and every step kicks up thick clouds of dust. 
        Shafts of pale sunlight pierce through gaps in the broken roof, illuminating shattered tools, torn tarps, and piles of splintered wood.
