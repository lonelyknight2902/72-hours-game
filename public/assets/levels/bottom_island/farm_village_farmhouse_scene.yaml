hour_value: 5
scene_description: |
  The land here smells of broken earth and splintered wood.
  The old barns and family homes now lie collapsed in tangled heaps of timber and stone.
  As reported by the locals, two survivors were last seen — one near the main barn, another inside the old farmhouse — but no one has heard from them since the shaking stopped.
  You and your team stand at the edge of the wreckage, boots sinking into the muddy soil.

        However, the locals have reported last seeing a little girl playing in the old farmhouse and a middle-age farmer in the main barn.

        Your team breaches the farmhouse, stepping over splintered beams and shattered furniture. The air’s thick with dust, and every creak of the structure puts you on edge. 
        You frown at the debris under your feet, and try to look for any signs of life and movement.
