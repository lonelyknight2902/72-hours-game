  After finishing your mission at the church, your team and officer Ruth meet each other at the lighthouse. 
  Standing at the survivors' camp, you see a woman tightly holding her daughter's hand, her eyes scanning the crowd with desperate hope. 
  The girl clings to her mother, a small teddy bear tucked under her arm, as they wait for news of Adam, their husband and father, still missing since the earthquake.
