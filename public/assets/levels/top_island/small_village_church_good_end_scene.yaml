  You and your team arrive at the church, where another team is tirelessly clearing debris. 
  They’ve been working for hours but can’t find a way to the little girl trapped inside. 
  Her faint cries echo through the rubble, and desperation grips the air. 
  The other team’s commander, eyes filled with worry, calls out, pleading for your help to find a path before the unstable structure collapses.
