hour_value: 5
scene_description: |
  You and your team arrive at the church, where another team is tirelessly clearing debris. They’ve been working for hours but can’t find a way to reach the little girl trapped inside. Her faint cries echo through the rubble, growing weaker by the minute. Desperation chokes the air as the other team’s commander, voice breaking, begs for your help to find a path before the unstable structure collapses entirely.

        player_2: 'Lily, please, wake up!'
        narrative_3: 'You reach for her, but a sickening crack splits the air. The ceiling collapses, forcing you back. The gap seals shut, silencing her forever.'
